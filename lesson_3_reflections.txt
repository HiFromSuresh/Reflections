When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working as a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So we can choose the part we want. Others may be working on other branches which we may not want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches is to create branch within our system file.
Clone brings the file from github to system.
Fork copies another person repository to our github account.
